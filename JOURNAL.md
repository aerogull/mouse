## 10/9/2025 - started working on the basic devboard  

i worked with the adafruit feather m0 devboard and started customizing it to my spec. figured out some parts i needed and decided not to use the rp2040 for now. i've almost finished making sure everything is correct, and i'll be triple checking everything against the docs soon. i also added the mouse sensors according to the specs provided by pixart. ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTMwOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6276fa1554aa9470053b2d1d058201fc44453d6a/image.png)
