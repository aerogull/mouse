## 10/9/2025 7 PM - started working on the basic devboard  

i worked with the adafruit feather m0 devboard and started customizing it to my spec. figured out some parts i needed and decided not to use the rp2040 for now. i've almost finished making sure everything is correct, and i'll be triple checking everything against the docs soon. i also added the mouse sensors according to the specs provided by pixart. ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTMwOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6276fa1554aa9470053b2d1d058201fc44453d6a/image.png)  

## 10/9/2025 8 PM - added 1.9v and switches  

i added the linear voltage regulator and supporting electronics for the 1.9v current required to run the paw3395 sensor. i also started adding the wiring for the mouse switches. they use spst switches from omron. i also added rc filter to each of the switches, using a 1.5kOhm resistor and a 1uF capaciator. also, i sectioned off the schematic.![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTMzNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--523bb50679f0954ff9352f04f2b31dc59555c1fd/image.png)

i finished wiring all the separate parts of the board together, and added an ec11 rotary encoder for a scroll wheel. I wired up all the serial spi and interrupt pins for the mouse sensor, changed the micro-usb to usb-c as well as wiring up 2 more leds on an active-low configuration to the main mcu.
